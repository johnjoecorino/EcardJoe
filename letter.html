    <h3>Dear Papa,<br><br>
      Merry Christmas! First of all, I want to thank you for all the love, sacrifices, and guidance you give me every
      day. I can't explain how much I admire and thank you for everything you do for our family.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      This Christmas season, I would like to extend my wish that I can give you the same joy and love as you give us.
      Your care is the best gift I receive, and I always promise to return it with love and respect.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      It's Christmas again, and even though I can't always say it, I want you to know how much I love you. I hope we
      celebrate a happy and peaceful Christmas with our family. I love you so much, Papa.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Always remember that I'm here for you, just like you've always been there for me. Merry Christmas and Happy New
      Year!!
    </h3>
